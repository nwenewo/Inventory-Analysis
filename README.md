## 📌 Project Overview

This project uses **Tableau** to perform an **Inventory Analysis** across multiple product categories and regions. The dashboard helps businesses track **inventory stock levels, turnover, and revenue contribution** while identifying opportunities to optimize stock allocation.

## 🎯 Objectives

* Analyze **COGS (Cost of Goods Sold)** by product categories.
* Track **inventory stock performance over time**.
* Visualize **geographical sales distribution**.
* Compare **inventory turnover ratios** by category.
* Provide actionable **recommendations** for stock optimization.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

* **Inventory Dataset** – (COGS, revenue, quantity, category, country)

## 📊 Dashboard Features

1. **COGS by Category (2020)**

   * Breakdown of cost contributions by product category.

2. **Country Breakdown (2021)**

   * Interactive map showing global sales distribution.

3. **Inventory Stock by Year**

   * Side-by-side comparison of stock sold in 2020 vs 2021 across categories.

* **Class B items** should be increased in stock to balance inventory distribution.
* Certain countries show stronger demand and can be targeted for optimized supply.


Would you also like me to **add a professional “Problem–Solution–Impact” section** (good for recruiters & portfolio) so your README reads more like a case study?
